# Boletim Paranaguá

The script download data from Paranaguá Counsil Website and convert the pdf to csv to be easier to work from machine. The csv are used to plot maps in script .... Website to download is http://www.paranagua.pr.gov.br/boletim-epidemiologico.php .

Still testing better approach. Need to test pypdf4, tabula-py and camelot.
